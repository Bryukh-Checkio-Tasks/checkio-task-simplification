<p>
    You are given a mathematical expression with brackets and with one variable as a string (ex. "x*x*x + (x-1)*(x+1)").
    You should convert this to a Polynomial. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial">Read more about this subject at Wikipedia</a>).
    You can only use the following expressions: + - *.
    Power of "x" may be represented by multiplication.
</p>
    <p> The final form of the polynoomial must be in the following format:<br>
     Ð¡N*x*x*...(n times)...*x+CN1*x*x*...(n-1 times)...*x+...+C1*x+C0<br>
    where<br>
    CN, CN1 ...C1, C0 - constants, integers.<br>
    if C = 0, then don't show this term (ex. 2*x*x+3)<br>
    if C = 1, then don't show C. (ex. x*x+2*x).<br>
    if C = -1, then don't show C, only "-". (ex. x*x-x).<br>

    Terms must be in descend order, sorted by the power of the variable.

<p><strong>Input: </strong>An expression as a string (unicode string).</p>

<p><strong>Output: </strong>A polynomial as a string without whitespaces.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="brush: python">checkio(u"x*x*x+(x-1)*(x+1)") == "x*x*x+x*x-1"
checkio("(x+1)*(x+1)") == "x*x+2*x+1"
checkio("(x+3)*x*2-x*x") == "x*x+6*x"
checkio("x+x*x+x*x*x") == "x*x*x+x*x+x"
checkio("(2*x+3)*2-x+x*x*x*x") == "x*x*x*x+3*x+6"</pre>
